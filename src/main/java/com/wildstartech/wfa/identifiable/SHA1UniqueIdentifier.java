/**
 * Universal Unique Identifier SHA1 implementation.

 * The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) produces a 160-bit digest for any "message"
 * less than 2^64 bits in length.  The SHA-1 is "secure" because it is 
 * computationally infeasible to two different "messages" which will produce
 * the same digest.
