        <p>The Wildstar Foundation Architecture (WFA) is a collection of general
            interfaces and classes for modeling common, every day business entities
            and processes. The primary focus of the WFA initiative is to deconstruct 
            complex entities and processes into their constituent elements.  The
            intent is to maximize the reuse of programming code by assembling a suite 
            of reusable components that can be leveraged in software solutions that
            cross a number ofdifferent problem domains.</p>
        <p>The following is a high level overview of the packages that comprise
            the entirety of the Wildstar Foundation Architecture.</p>
